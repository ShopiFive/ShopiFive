## Challenge:

How might Shopify better leverage its Ecosystem to make entrepreneurship more accessible than ever before?

## Objective:

Redesign the business plan template that shopify has for users (currently a google doc) with the goal to gamify it, make it easier and less intimidating for users to solidify their goals before building their website.

## Benefits of Our App:

- **Better Merchant Support/Relationship:** Increasing the amount of educational and business resources may help to facilitate a closer relationship between Shopify and Merchants.

- **Higher Retention Rate:** If creating business plans increase the likelihood of a business succeeding, then users of the app are more likely to continue paying for a Shopify subscription.
